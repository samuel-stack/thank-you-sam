I was drenched in the birth goos of supervised/unsupervised machine learning techniques, SQL, time-series, free lunches and more. I understood none of it, but you took me in like an orphaned child. You fed me with your milk of knowledge. You showed me the light. Thank you. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Sam was always patient and helpful when I ran to his table in the back to get assistance for whatever issue (there were quite a few-especially in the beginning). As the weeks flew by our cohort began to witness a Sam that is very different than the pic plastered on the wall in CR1. He is a great storyteller with his wry observations and humor. Sam, I wish you all the best as you embark on the next chapter in your career; you've been fabulous and I'll always be grateful for everything you did to make these 12 weeks easier.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Sam has been an excellent colleague and prior student. He executes well (and independently) on his work and actively looks for other areas to make a difference. He was a tremendous resource for the students: ready to answer questions, patient, and often went beyond traditional work hours to assure their needs were met. Plus, I'm jealous of his outrageous humor and tons of shoes. I wish you the best in your next adventure, Sam! - Joseph, Data Science Immersive Instructor</p>

            <br>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As the first DSIR and affectless instructor, I paved the way for Sam. But he certainly made the role his own with sweet hair, red shoes and constant trolling. Also, he brought me a cupcake once. And a donut. He's cool in my book.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">"Dedicated"
                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Sam, I'm definitely going to miss you. You've shouldered our burdens, you were as dedicated as us, you cared for the students, and made our experience better through humor. It'll be Sad! to not see you every day in the office. I hope that where you go next has as many avocados as your heart and shoes can enjoy. - Matt, Data Science Immersive Instructor</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">"Always willing to jump in"
                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Sam has been an awesome colleague to have around these past few months. In the time I’ve work with him, he’s always been willing to jump in and help with things that are often outside of the scope of a DIR’s role. I also appreciate his sharp and sarcastic wit that he brings to the team – it’s much appreciated! More than anything, it’s been great to see Sam go from a prospective student, to graduate, to TA and really embrace and get excited about the depth of knowledge he’s cultivated this past year. Best of luck as a data wizard, Sam!</p>

            <br>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I can't speak to Sam's ability to teach. Hell, I don't even know if he knows anything about data science, but as far as being a decent human, he's up there. Kind, humorous and an upstanding member of the team, there's no doubt he will be missed and wherever he goes next, he'll certainly be cherished. When I had to stick it out in the office, I was always glad to have him there. All the best, friend! -ZT, UX Design Immersive Lead Instructor </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I never knew if you were joking or were serious when you were first talking to me. Nevertheless, one thing I never doubted was your passion to teach and continue learning. I am fortunate to have worked with you these past few months. I hope you continue being as awesome as you were in your next position. Stay in touch and don’t be a stranger. - Phil, Instructor Manager</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Sam is awesome. His dedication to creating a positive learning environment for his students is inspiring, and his enthusiasm for the sharing his knowlege is awesome. Sam has been a fantastic colleague and an outrageous friend. I plan to constantly jab at whoever replaces him with snide comments about how Sam was better. It will be true. - Alex, UXDI Sam Clone</p>
