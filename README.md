## Thank you, Sam

This repository was created without Sam's knowledge.

Upon finishing up as a Data Scientist in Residence at General Assembly, we wanted to create a static site that commemorates all the things we appreciate about Sam's stellar performance. We opted to host that site on Sam's own Github so that he would have total control over it.

Thank you, Sam. Enjoy the kind notes that you can't lose unless Github goes down or you change your Github username (thanks, Github Pages).
