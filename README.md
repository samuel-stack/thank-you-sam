## Thank you, Sam

This repository was created without Sam's knowledge. It hosts this [site](https://samuel-stack.github.io/thank-you-sam/)

Upon finishing up as a Data Scientist in Residence at General Assembly's [Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive?utm_medium=social&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=josephdsi) program, we wanted to create a static site that commemorates all the things we appreciate about Sam's stellar performance. We opted to host that site on Sam's own Github so that he would have total control over it after we surprised him with its delivery. (Sam trusted me to play with his Github credentials without too many questions.)

Thank you, Sam. Enjoy the kind notes that you can't lose unless Github goes down or you change your Github username (thanks, Github Pages).
